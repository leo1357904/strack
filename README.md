# Strack - Track your Stack

## Quick intro
This project is a web app project in course CMU 17437 with team of 3.
The idea is that there are a lot of courses require students to understand low-level insight, to know the asembly code and what it is like in the stack.
Thus, our team decide to make our own online tool that the users can upload a c file and the website will compile and show the information of stack, registers, flags, and so on.

The users can register an account or use Google OAuth2 to login. The users then can see the code history, manage their codes, and see others' special codes through the dashboard.
